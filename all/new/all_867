GOP complaints about the Fed have grown since the central bank lowered interest rates to zero and started quantitative easing programs. Those measures were unprecedented in the Fed's history.

Businesses have been on a job-creating hot streak, adding 3.2 million jobs over 67 straight weeks. At 5.1 percent in September, the unemployment rate is below the White House's forecast for next year. Auto sales are booming. Foreclosures have fallen, and home prices are approaching the heights they reached before the housing bubble burst. Yet the Fed's interest rate target hasn't moved from where it was when unemployment reached 10 percent. If all goes to plan, that will change later this year, when the central bank is likely to feel comfortable enough in the recovery to begin raising its interest rate target.

If economic reports point to job growth and rising inflation, December could be a live possibility, Yellen said, but importantly no decision has been made. In responding to questions from Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., Yellen minimized the threats facing the economy. At this point, I see the U.S. economy as performing well, she said.

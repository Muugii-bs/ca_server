Businesses have been on a job-creating hot streak, adding 3.2 million jobs over 67 straight weeks. At 5.1 percent in September, the unemployment rate is below the White House's forecast for next year. Auto sales are booming. Foreclosures have fallen, and home prices are approaching the heights they reached before the housing bubble burst. Yet the Fed's interest rate target hasn't moved from where it was when unemployment reached 10 percent. If all goes to plan, that will change later this year, when the central bank is likely to feel comfortable enough in the recovery to begin raising its interest rate target.

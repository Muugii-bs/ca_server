The White House on Thursday announced the U.S.-Pakistan Clean Energy Partnership to kickstart more clean energy investments in Pakistan by the private sector. The goal is to add 3,000 megawatts of clean energy power to Pakistan's electrical system. The new partnership continues the joint efforts by the United States and Pakistan to sustainably address Pakistan's energy needs, according to a White House fact sheet. The partnership also reflects Pakistan's commitment to help curb climate change, particularly as Pakistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to its effects. Since 2009, the U.S. has worked with Pakistan through the U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue. The U.S. has spent more than $1 billion since then to support energy infrastructure investments, leading to 1,700 more megawatts of power in Pakistan's electrical grid.

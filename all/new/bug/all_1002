Why do you guys always leave that part out, I wonder? asked Carson, who is fourth in the Washington Examiner's presidential power rankings. Host Martha Raddatz replied: I don't think we do, Dr. Carson, and it really was quite clear: 'I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.'

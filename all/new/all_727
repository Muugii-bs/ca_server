Samantha Powers, U.S. envoy to the United Nations, submitted a formal complaint to the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday alleging that Tehran's Oct. 10 test of a missile supposedly capable of traveling 900-1,100 miles and bearing a maneuverable warhead was a violation of a U.N. resolution specifically barring Iran from such launches. The missile has a maneuverable warhead to improve accuracy and complicate anti-missile defenses. We firmly believe it is a violation [of the resolution] but that process needs to work its way through the United Nations, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. I'm not going to prejudge the result of that process.

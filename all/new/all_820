The 32-year-old CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals has been widely criticized since announcing over the summer that he was raising the price of an old, lifesaving anti-parasite drug by 5,000 percent. But the public outcry against him reached a fever pitch Thursday, soon after the hoodie-cloaked Shkreli was hauled off from his Manhattan home by the FBI on charges of securities fraud. Within hours, his name was trending on Twitter \u2014 and not because people were writing flattering things about him. Martin Shkreli wasn't a successful a-hole after all, just an a-hole, tweeted Daily Beast executive editor Noah Shachtman. Many others mocked Shkreli's arrest.

Imprimis Pharmaceuticals said Thursday that it would make a formulation that is similar to Daraprim, whose price Turing Pharmaceuticals jacked up almost overnight from $13.50 to $750 a pill. The 5,000-percent price hike started a wave of public attacks on the small drug maker's 32-year-old CEO Martin Shkreli. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton repeatedly accused Shkreli of price gouging, and her competitor Bernie Sanders refused a donation from the former hedge fund manager. Now Imprimis is stepping in to offer what it calls a cheaper alternative to Daraprim. It would start offering the formulation as low as $99 for a 100-count bottle, the company said Thursday.
